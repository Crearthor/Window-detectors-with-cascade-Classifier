This app uses Haar cascade classifier to deteckt windows from images or camera image. It allows to choose:
a) detection of photos with window(positives folder) or without windows(negatives folder) 
b) to perform detection automatically or manually(you see detection result for each photo one by one)
c) to get basic information like number of detections, photos and in how many photos object was detected or to get extended information. In second option you must manually give a number undetected windows, detected windows and incorrect detections in image, for this option you get info about incorrect dettections in all images, how many windows was detected right,how many windows wasn`t detected in photos, number of multiple detection of one object and percentage result of how much windows was detected and incorrect detections against the whole detection. Automatically detection gives only basic info.
All detection results are saved into Converted folder as new images files.
